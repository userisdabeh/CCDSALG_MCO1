## This repository is for the official MCO1 Project in CCDSALG, AY 2025-2026.
### Goal: Constructing Suffix Arrays using Sorting Algorithms

## Team Members:
- Gagala, Dave
- Maglente, Michael
- Osena, Khloe
- Valdez, Matthew

1. Generates all suffixes of a string.
2. Sorts these suffixes using two sorting algorithms:
Algorithm 1: Merge
Algorithm 2: Heap Sort 
3. Prints:
All suffixes with indices
Sorted suffixes with indices
Suffix array (just indices in sorted order)
Measures execution time for both algorithms on random DNA strings of various lengths.
Reports results (analysis + timing table + explanation)
