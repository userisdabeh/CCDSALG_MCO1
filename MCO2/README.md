Osena:  constructor, adjacency-list initialization, addEdge, loadFromFile (graph loading and parsing). and  printMenu
Member 2: getFriends (friend-list retrieval/formatting) and report. 
Member 3: findConnection (BFS and path reconstruction).
Member 4:main and runMenu (interactive flow, menu loop, packaging/testing responsibilities).
Requirements
Read the dataset file and load its graph structure.
Given an ID, display the list of that person’s friends.
Given two IDs, display their connection path (if any).

Part 1: Loading the Graph
Program must read the filename or file path from user input.
Graph must be stored efficiently.
Data structure choice must be justified in the report.
After loading, program must show a menu repeatedly.

Part 2: Display Friend List
Program prompts the user for an ID.
If ID does not exist, show an error and return to menu.
Otherwise, display:
The total number of friends
The friend list itself

Part 3: Display Connections
Program prompts user for two IDs.
If invalid, show error but do not terminate.
If valid:
Show the connection path if it exists
Otherwise state that no connection was found
A connection is a sequence of nodes where each adjacent pair are friends.

Writing the Report
Report must include:
Introduction and overview
Data structure used + rationale
Algorithms used for:
Friend list
Connection finding
Time complexity analysis
Findings, insights, and reflections
Group member list and group number
Contribution table
